GitHUB HW 1/24/2023
I am really excited about this HW because many times have I worked on github but not fully understood it. I loved learning these skills because I think now I will be able to take what I learned and apply it to all the things that I use especially this project. I think it is interesting how it is most efficient to clone the repositories so they are linked well. Before, I just would make commits without the cloned repo and it was fine but this is much more efficient.
