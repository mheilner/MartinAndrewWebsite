how about I try and make this change in the env

GitHUB HW 1/24/2023
I am really excited about this HW because many times have I worked on github but not fully understood it. I loved learning these skills because I think now I will be able to take what I learned and apply it to all the things that I use especially this project. I think it is interesting how it is most efficient to clone the repositories so they are linked well. Before, I just would make commits without the cloned repo and it was fine but this is much more efficient.

AWS EC2
Server IP: http://18.224.198.116/
I have a pem file with this
Here is the ssh command: --  ssh -i C:\Users\markh\Downloads\[pem] ubuntu@[ip]

AWS Route 53
http://martinandrew.org
This is the DNS used for my IP above. I thought it was really interesting being able to map the subdomains to the website. It makes sense that there are many user errors and being able to adapt the route 53 to compensate for this with subdomains makes it ver helpful. I am excited to keep learning more about this.

HTTPS/Web Certificates HW
For this assignment, we had to update the website security by chaning the vim caddyfile in the ssh to the website domainname - martinandrew.org. This secures the network. I was shocked that this was so expensive before 2014 for even the smaller companies. I think this is a cool thing that it is much more accessible the website security.

Intro: https://codepen.io/mheilner/pen/ZEjPjMV This is my codepen fork that I made for this assignment.
https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/html/introduction/introduction.md
That is the link to the HTML intro. It explores a couple of the essential basic points of HTML and how to use it for the best experieence.
HTML Structure

SIMON HTML - simon.martinandrew.org
So this was a really great learning experience for the fact that I had issues is my Caddfile in the AWS terminal. I hadn't changed over the name for my subdomain so it made it kind of challenging for me to find out how to get my simon.domain to go live. I think that the most important part of this assignment was learning that. Aside from that I would say that learning all the new tag names was helpful

CSS PRACTICE
https://codepen.io/mheilner/pen/GRXRKoq?editors=1100
This assignment was cool because it brought to life what webdev can do. I think that animation makes things so much more interesting when interacting with a website so this will be awesome to use for a website.
