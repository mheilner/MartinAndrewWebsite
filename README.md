# startup
This is my startup repository

I am making this modification for my github hw assignments

This is a change that I am making to the Readme in github as part 6

how about I try and make this change in the env

GitHUB HW 1/24/2023
I am really excited about this HW because many times have I worked on github but not fully understood it. I loved learning these skills because I think now I will be able to take what I learned and apply it to all the things that I use especially this project. I think it is interesting how it is most efficient to clone the repositories so they are linked well. Before, I just would make commits without the cloned repo and it was fine but this is much more efficient.

AWS EC2
Server IP: http://18.224.198.116/
I have a pem file with this
Here is the ssh command: --  ssh -i C:\Users\markh\Downloads\[pem] ubuntu@[ip]

AWS Route 53
http://martinandrew.org
This is the DNS used for my IP above. I thought it was really interesting being able to map the subdomains to the website. It makes sense that there are many user errors and being able to adapt the route 53 to compensate for this with subdomains makes it ver helpful. I am excited to keep learning more about this.

HTTPS/Web Certificates HW
For this assignment, we had to update the website security by chaning the vim caddyfile in the ssh to the website domainname - martinandrew.org. This secures the network. I was shocked that this was so expensive before 2014 for even the smaller companies. I think this is a cool thing that it is much more accessible the website security.

HMTL Links:
Intro: https://codepen.io/mheilner/pen/ZEjPjMV This is my codepen fork that I made for this assignment.
https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/html/introduction/introduction.md
That is the link to the HTML intro. It explores a couple of the essential basic points of HTML and how to use it for the best experieence.
HTML Structure
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp (good info for understanding the tags)

HTML input

SIMON HTML - simon.martinandrew.org
So this was a really great learning experience for the fact that I had issues is my Caddfile in the AWS terminal. I hadn't changed over the name for my subdomain so it made it kind of challenging for me to find out how to get my simon.domain to go live. I think that the most important part of this assignment was learning that. Aside from that I would say that learning all the new tag names was helpful

CSS PRACTICE
https://codepen.io/mheilner/pen/GRXRKoq?editors=1100
This assignment was cool because it brought to life what webdev can do. I think that animation makes things so much more interesting when interacting with a website so this will be awesome to use for a website.



STARTUP PROJECT 2/24
https://getbootstrap.com/
DEPLOY ISSUE
I was having trouble running the deployFile.sh but it was because I had to change the permissions - chmod 777 deploy...

What I learned: it is super useful to understand how to work with CSS and HTML and using some bootstrap. I think the best thing that I learned was that you can make sub-tags within sections that you make. For example you can have a p tag be different depending on the main section. That is cool.
PERMISSIONS
-changed the permissions to more private and the ~/.ssh is where the pem is

Codepen JS Regex 2/24
I liked this assignment. Regex is something that can be very useful and it is helpful to know all about the use of regex and JS.
https://codepen.io/mheilner/pen/vYzgLpw
https://codepen.io/mheilner/pen/yLxgeMM

JS DOM
https://codepen.io/mheilner/pen/gOdgrBx
This was a fun assignment because this really started to show how you can use JS for HTML and CSS. Hopefully, we can do more.
JS Promises
This is one of the more confusing things that we have learned. I hope we can learn a bit more of the specifics of making this useful. I think the cool thing is the race function that pits multiple promises against eachother.

Async Await
This one is more confusing for me. Interesting to see when the asynchronous functions are going to be used.
